Data Structures
---------------
1. list
2. dictionary
3. tuple
4. set


list
----
list is the same as an array

array?
------
1. collection of homogenous data
2. memory allocation is contigious


Lists
-----
1. list are collection of hetrogenous data
2. memory allocation is not contigious
3. lists are ordered collection
4. lists are subscriptable
5. list is enclosed in []
6. lists are mutable
 


l2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, [11, 22, 33, 44, 55], 7, 8, 9]
print(l2)

Shallow Copy
------------
l2 = l1

it not only shares the data from the list l1 to l2 but also shares the address from l1 to l2


Deep Copy
---------
l4 = l3.copy()

it only shares the data not the address


Dictionaries
------------
1. also called as associative arrays
2. dictionaries will store data in the form of keys and values
	a. keys are like indexes in arrays, advantage is keys are user defined
	b. values are the data that has to be stored
3. all keys of a dictionary is unique
4. dictionaries are mutable
5. ordered collection
6. dictionaries are enclosed in {key and value}

d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

copy
----

d1 = d2
d1 = d2.copy


d1 = d2.copy
from copy import deepcopy
d1 = deepcopy(d2)

Tuples
------
1. tuples are immutable lists
2. they are ordered collection
3. they are subscriptable
4. they are enclosed in ()


Sets
----
1. elements of a set is unique
2. sets are unordered collection
3. sets cannot be subscripted
4. sets are mutable
5. sets are enclosed in {}
